In this event, we test your grasp on programming languages through a series of questions about coding and finding an output. It is a competitive, time-bound game consisting of **4 knockout levels**. In each level, you have to solve a problem statement using your desired programming language and reach an output. After each round, you will receive a clue of where to find your next problem statement. The level of questions increases after each round.

### Team

A team may consist of a maximum of **3 participants** and a minimum of **1 participant**.

### Requirements

- You need to bring your own laptop (with an offline compiler installed).  
- No sort of internet will be provided, and phones will be kept for security.

### Rules and Regulations

- One of the team players will solve the code, and the other is meant to run to the location in the code and bring back the envelope.  
- The seal of the envelope must be opened in front of the coordinator. If the seal is found broken, you will be disqualified.  
- The decision of the judge is final and not subject to review or appeal.  
- You can code in any language and on any compiler **EXCEPT PYTHON**.  
- Use of any unfair means will lead to disqualification, including the use of Google or any AI to steal or copy code.  
- Rules are subject to change before the final briefing session.

> **Note:** Violation of any of the above rules will lead to disqualification.

All participants are required to adhere to these rules throughout the event. In this event, we take you on a journey designed to challenge your logical thinking and problem-solving skills, all without the use of a computer screen. Participants will go through three rounds, with each round presenting a unique logical problem to challenge their critical thinking and problem-solving abilities.

### Team

A team may consist of a maximum of 2 participants and a minimum of 1 participant.

### Rules and Regulations

- **Platform:** Participants are required to use only an online compiler for the event.  
- Any participant found using unfair methods will be immediately disqualified.

#### Round 1 (Easy Level)
- Participants will be given **20 minutes** to code the solution for the given questions in the first round.  
**Scoring:**  
  - 10 points for a perfect answer.  
  - 1 point will be deducted for every error.

#### Round 2 (Intermediate Level)
- Participants will be given **40 minutes** to code the solution for the given questions in the second round.  
**Scoring:**  
  - 10 points for a perfect answer.  
  - 1 point will be deducted for every error.

#### Round 3 (Final Level)
- Participants will be given a total of **40 minutes** to solve a single question.  
- The round is divided into two phases:  
    1. First phase â€“ 20 minutes of coding with the screen turned on.  
    2. After a minute pause, the screen will be turned off, and participants will continue coding for the remaining time with the screen off.  
**Scoring:**  
  - 10 points for a perfect answer.  
  - 1 point will be deducted for every error.

- Ensure you have a stable internet connection for the duration of the event.  
- Maintain decorum and follow instructions provided by the organizers.  
- The decisions of the organizing committee will be final and binding in all matters.  

Good luck to all participants and may the best coder win!
