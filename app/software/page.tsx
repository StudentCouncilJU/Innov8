Bid-2-Code is not just an event, it is an immersive journey where intellect meets innovation.  
Participants enter a vibrant marketplace, where every bid, every choice, and every idea carries weight.  
From the fierce auction of power cards, to crafting ingenious prototypes with limited resources, and finally, to the high-stakes pitch before the jury, this competition mirrors the real world of technology and entrepreneurship.  

Here, fortune favors not just the coders, but the visionaries who can strategize, innovate, and persuade.  
The champions of Bid-2-Code will be those who dare to think differently, build fearlessly, and sell their vision with brilliance.  

**Bid with wisdom. Build with purpose. Pitch with power.**

---

## Team Specification
- Minimum of 3 and maximum of 4 participants will form a team.

---

## Rules & Regulations

- Using their remaining budget, they must purchase programming languages, frameworks, and technologies from the marketplace.  
- Teams will then develop a prototype/technical solution using only the resources they bought.  
- Judges will evaluate based on:
    1. Creativity of solution  
    2. Efficient use of purchased technologies  
    3. Functionality & innovation  

> From all participants, the judges will shortlist the top 30 teams, who will then face an engaging Q&A session with the jury. Based on their performance, the best 15 teams will advance to Round 3.

### Round 3 – Pitching
- The top 15 teams from Round 2 will qualify.  
- Teams must pitch their project to the judges in a startup-style showdown.  
- Evaluation will be based on:
    1. Clarity & Persuasiveness of Pitch  
    2. Technical Depth of Solution  
    3. Business/Market Value Representation  

- The team with the highest bank balance (money + project value) will be crowned the Bid-2-Code Champions.

All participants are required to adhere to these rules throughout the event.  
In this event, we take you on a journey designed to challenge your logical thinking and problem-solving skills, all without the use of a computer screen.  
Participants will go through three rounds, with each round presenting a unique logical problem to challenge their critical thinking and problem-solving abilities.

            description={`### About

In this event, we test your grasp on programming languages through a series of questions about coding and finding an output. It is a competitive, time-bound game consisting of **4 knockout levels**. In each level, you have to solve a problem statement using your desired programming language and reach an output. After each round, you will receive a clue of where to find your next problem statement. The level of questions increases after each round.

### Team

A team may consist of a maximum of **3 participants** and a minimum of **1 participant**.

### Requirements

- You need to bring your own laptop (with an offline compiler installed).  
- No sort of internet will be provided, and phones will be kept for security.

### Rules and Regulations

- One of the team players will solve the code, and the other is meant to run to the location in the code and bring back the envelope.
