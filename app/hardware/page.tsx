The main aim of this event is to design and build a highly dynamic machine—a robot—that isn’t just about mechanics but about agility, precision, and teamwork. These bots will step into the soccer arena, dribble, pass, and score, bringing the thrill of the game to life in a whole new way.

### Team

Teams can have a maximum of **4 participants** and a minimum of **1 participant**.  
Members from different educational institutions are allowed to form a team.

### Rules and Regulations

- The competition involves a **one-on-one soccer match** played with tennis balls.  
- Robots will start in their respective halves of an arena measuring **12 feet by 6 feet**, made of wooden ply. Each side has a goalpost **20 cm wide**.  
- Each team designates a **robot handler** to control the robot during the game and a **wire and battery handler** to manage the power supply.  
- Only designated team members are allowed inside the game zone, while other team members must remain outside.  
- The objective is to **score goals by pushing the ball into the opponent's goal**. The team with the most goals at the end of the match wins.  
- If the ball leaves the arena, it will be placed at the centre, and play will resume from there.  
- In case of a draw, an additional time for a quick scorer will be given. The first one to score will be the winner.  
- The duration of matches, penalty procedures, and other specific rules will be announced on the day of the event.  
- Misbehavior or unsportsmanlike conduct may result in disqualification. Any deliberate interference with other robots or causing damage leads to automatic disqualification.  
- The organizers reserve the right to modify any or all rules on the spot as they see fit.  
- If any team has any issue with the opposite team bots, it has to be resolved **before the match**, else the issue will not be addressed.

### Machine Specifications

    - Maximum Length: **300 mm**  
    - Maximum Width: **300 mm**  
    - Maximum Height: **300 mm**  
    - Maximum Weight: **5 Kg**

- The weight of every bot must be strictly checked before the start of the event.  
- No additional tolerance will be provided in size and weight.  
- The robot must not exceed a potential difference of **12V between any two points**.  
- The control device (used to operate the robot) is excluded from the size limitations.  
- The robot can be either **wired or wireless**.  
- The use of Lego parts or pre-assembled kits is prohibited; however, participants are encouraged to creatively design their own kick mechanisms.  
- The robot can be powered by either:
    - An onboard power source (e.g., a fixed battery)  
    - A stationary power source connected to the robot via a cord.

- Participants are responsible for bringing **spare batteries** to ensure the robot remains operational during matches.  
Failure to do so may result in disqualification if the robot cannot compete or stops mid-match.  

- In case of a wired connection, the wire must be a **minimum of 3 meters**, and though the battery is placed outside the arena, the weight of the battery is included in the weight of the bot.
